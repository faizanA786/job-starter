- Its getting tedious to go on numerous job boards seperatly to find my first job to get experience, its worse when their sort by functions dont work, or id search for retail assistant positions in london but then it shows me delivery driver positions outside of london
- So im making a web app thats gonna try to solve these issues, which could also be beneficial for other students like me
- Im targetting entry level jobs specifically because I have no experience myself, and targetting those in London (since I am in london)
- Jobs in retail and hospitality will be prioritised because they have almost no barrier to entry
- Only jobs not older than 3 days will be posted because you'd typically have a higher chance to hear back
- So far Ive added the basics of fetching job data via aduzna api, i used it because its free
- I need to style the page using css later because right now its an eyesore to read job posts on the page
- I also need to allow to categorise jobs by industry, and add a sort by function later
